# Exercise - Full Stack

Using all your skills in your kitbag: JavaScript, React.js, PostgreSQL, python, and flask build a Full Stack Application.

You can choose your own application but there must be at least 3 related tables and it must be an SPA (Single Page Application). You could use the same application from the SQL exercise. The application must include some CRUD functionality.
