# Exercise - Flask

Using your last exercise with clients, invoices, and items, create a flask application to show the info from the worksheet.  

Do it in the following ways all in the same server:

* Using basic flask just dump the contents to the browser in a very simple dump
* Use a flask template that loops through the data and displays into the browser
* Create an API to send a JSON document to a React frontend (SPA)

For this exercise concentrate on functionality; we will work on the look and feel later.
