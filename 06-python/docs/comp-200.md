# COMP-200: Python 101

## Exercise: Basic Syntax

This is the second programming language that we have encountered in this program. The syntax is different than JavaScript but the concept is the same. Both languages are OO ish and both languages are interpretive.

Review the new coding style as described: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/ 

Go to “Comp 100”  - “Exercise - Basic Syntax” and code the same exercise in Python. Create a file called src\python\syntax.py. When complete, compare the JavaScript code to the Python code. Notice the differences. Notice the Similarities.

## Exercise - TDD

Python has a sophisticated testing framework. Research the framework and use it as much as possible. Setup a few examples.

This course has a nice introduction to python TDD https://evolveu.udemy.com/unit-testing-and-tdd-in-python/learn/v4/overview 

NOTE: Do not use the virtual environment that the TDD video suggests, use pipenv.

## Exercise - Simple Functions

Write a function called “email”. This function will receive two parameters: first name and last name. It will return a well-formatted email. For example:

Larry Shumlich ⇒  larry.shumlich@evolveu.ca
Heiko Peters ⇒ heiko.peters@evolveu.ca 

Write the code in a function and call the function for each person you want to format the email for. Write an automated test that will check that the results are what you expect.

Email the test to larry before you write the code.

Write the tax function from the JavaScript exercise in Comp 100 - “Exercise - Canadian Taxes”.  Call it ‘src/python/cantax.py  Hard code some input.  Create the tests first. Copy and reuse as much code as possible:
